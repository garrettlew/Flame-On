# Flame-On
Flame On is a "stove on" reminder system that helps Senior Citizens and anyone with a fire/gas stove.

We don't want you to worry anymore about your stove.

A flame sensor and a carbon monoxide sensor is used by the device to checks if your stove is on.
A motion detector checks if somebody is cooking.
If the stove is on and no one is detected for a certain amount of time, an alarm goes off.
The alarm can be overided using by pressing an off button or if a person is detected.
